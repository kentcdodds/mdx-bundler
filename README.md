## The problem

You have a string of MDX and various TS/JS files that it uses and you want to
get a bundled version of these files to eval in the browser.

## This solution

This is an async function that will compile and bundle your MDX files and their
dependencies. It uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), so it's VERY fast
and supports TypeScript files (for the dependencies of your MDX files). It also
uses [xdm](https://github.com/wooorm/xdm) which is a more modern and powerful
MDX compiler with fewer bugs and more features (and no extra runtime
requirements).

Your source files could be local, in a remote github repo, in a CMS, or wherever
else and it doesn't matter. All `mdx-bundler` cares about is that you pass it
all the files and source code necessary and it will take care of bundling
everything for you.

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm] which is bundled with [node][node] and
should be installed as one of your project's `dependencies`:

```
npm install --save mdx-bundler
```

## Usage

```typescript
import {bundleMDX} from 'mdx-bundler'

const mdxSource = `
---
title: Example Post
published: 2021-02-13
description: This is some description
---

# Wahoo

import Demo from './demo'

Here's a **neat** demo:

<Demo />
`.trim()

const result = await bundleMDX(mdxSource, {
  files: {
    './demo.tsx': `
import * as React from 'react'

function Demo() {
  return <div>Neat demo!</div>
}

export default Demo
    `,
  },
})

const {code, frontmatter} = result
```

From there, you send the `code` to your client, and then:

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'
import {MDXProvider} from '@mdx-js/react'
import {getMDXComponent} from 'mdx-bundler/client'

function Post({code, frontmatter}) {
  // it's generally a good idea to memoize this function call to
  // avoid re-creating the component every render.
  const Component = React.useMemo(() => getMDXComponent(code), [code])
  return (
    <MDXProvider>
      <header>
        <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>
        <p>{frontmatter.description}</p>
      </header>
      <main>
        <Component />
      </main>
    </MDXProvider>
  )
}
```

Ultimately, this gets rendered (basically):

```html
<header>
  <h1>This is the title</h1>
  <p>This is some description</p>
</header>
<main>
  <div>
    <h1>Wahoo</h1>

    <p>Here's a <strong>neat</strong> demo:</p>

    <div>Neat demo!</div>
  </div>
</main>
```

### Options

#### files

The `files` config is an object of all the files you're bundling. The key is the
path to the file (relative to the MDX source) and the value is the string of the
file source code. You could get these from the filesystem or from a remote
database. If your MDX doesn't reference other files (or only imports things from
`node_modules`), then you can omit this entirely.

#### xdmOptions

This allows you to modify the built-in xdm configuration (passed to
xdm.compile). This can be helpful for specifying your own
remarkPlugins/rehypePlugins.

```ts
bundleMDX(mdxString, {
  xdmOptions(input, options) {
    // this is the recommended way to add custom remark/rehype plugins:
    // The syntax might look weird, but it protects you in case we add/remove
    // plugins in the future.
    options.remarkPlugins = [...(options.remarkPlugins ?? []), myRemarkPlugin]
    options.rehypePlugins = [...(options.rehypePlugins ?? []), myRehypePlugin]

    return options
  },
})
```

#### esbuildOptions

You can customize any of esbuild options with the option `esbuildOptions`. This
takes a function which is passed the default esbuild options and expects an
options object to be returned.

```typescript
bundleMDX(mdxSource, {
  esbuildOptions(options) {
    options.minify = false
    options.target = [
      'es2020',
      'chrome58',
      'firefox57',
      'safari11',
      'edge16',
      'node12',
    ]

    return options
  },
})
```

More information on the available options can be found in the
[esbuild documentation](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#build-api).

It's recommended to use this feature to configure the `target` to your desired
output, otherwise, esbuild defaults to `esnext` which is to say that it doesn't
compile any standardized features so it's possible users of older browsers will
experience errors.

#### globals

This tells esbuild that a given module is externally available. For example, if
your MDX file uses the d3 library and you're already using the d3 library in
your app then you'll end up shipping `d3` to the user twice (once for your app
and once for this MDX component). This is wasteful and you'd be better off just
telling esbuild to _not_ bundle `d3` and you can pass it to the component
yourself when you call `getMDXComponent`.

Here's an example:

```tsx
// server-side or build-time code that runs in Node:
import {bundleMDX} from 'mdx-bundler'

const mdxSource = `
# This is the title

import leftPad from 'left-pad'

<div>{leftPad("Neat demo!", 12, '!')}</div>
`.trim()

const result = await bundleMDX(mdxSource, {
  // NOTE: this is *only* necessary if you want to share deps between your MDX
  // file bundle and the host app. Otherwise, all deps will just be bundled.
  // So it'll work either way, this is just an optimization to avoid sending
  // multiple copies of the same library to your users.
  globals: {'left-pad': 'myLeftPad'},
})
```

```tsx
// server-rendered and/or client-side code that can run in the browser or Node:
import * as React from 'react'
import {MDXProvider} from '@mdx-js/react'
import leftPad from 'left-pad'
import {getMDXComponent} from 'mdx-bundler/client'

function MDXPage({code}: {code: string}) {
  const Component = React.useMemo(
    () => getMDXComponent(result.code, {myLeftPad: leftPad}),
    [result.code, leftPad],
  )
  return (
    <MDXProvider>
      <main>
        <Component />
      </main>
    </MDXProvider>
  )
}
```

## Inspiration

As I was rewriting [kentcdodds.com](https://kentcdodds.com) to
[remix](https://remix.run), I decided I wanted to keep my blog posts as MDX, but
I didn't want to have to compile them all at build time or be required to
redeploy every time I fix a typo. So I made this which allows my server to
compile on demand.

## Other Solutions

There's [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) but it's
more of an mdx-compiler than a bundler (can't bundle your mdx for dependencies).
Also it's focused on Next.js whereas this is meta-framework agnostic.
